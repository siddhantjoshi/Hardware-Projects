### Hardware Projects
###### I love to play with elctronics and also to create intresting stuff from that i have create some and thus put them all in this repo have a look,

### Things I learned

```markdown
1. Circuit Design
>Circuit Design is an Art similar to panting, before creting nay circuit a deigner ha to think in every aspect like
 the astehetic view of the bord on which this circuit is going to mounted on, will this circuit get proper cooling
 or will have to add some heat sinks to the design<br> Circuit design s not jsut ot add some resistorbased on 
 calucaltion of current or connecting some wire it is beyond that. 

2. 3D design
>Befor creation of any project an basic layout is being made to imagine how the product/ Project will look and if
 that view is in<br> 3D then it is easy to imagine the product also to make correction based on user case  

3. Project management
>Therer is a quote of bill gate "No matter how much money you have, you can't buy more time." Thus it was obvious
 to learn to manage<br> my time during my bachlor's degree of Electronics and Telecommunication which i did by
 using some Managemnet tool like SCRUM and AGILE which software industries use.
